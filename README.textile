h2. What is Compass?

Compass is a clustering mechanism which respects the connection
between independent variables in examples/instances. 

Compass accepts n data points and uses an O(n) fastmap routine to find
the two most separated points in the current selection.  With a
distance metric, the remaining points are shifted to one pole or
another and the algorithm recurses on itself until a stopping point is
reached.  Compass stops when a minimum leaf size is reached, which is
generally the sqrt(n).

A Compass tree is then pruned back by removing areas of radically
increasing variance.
