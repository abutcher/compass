h2. What is Compass?

Compass is a clustering mechanism which respects the connection
between independent variables in examples/instances.

Compass accepts n data points and uses an O(n) fastmap routine to find
the two most separated points in the current selection.  With a
distance metric, the remaining points are shifted to one pole or
another and the algorithm recurses on itself until a stopping point is
reached.  Compass stops when a minimum leaf size is reached, which is
generally the sqrt(n).

A Compass tree is then pruned back by removing areas of radically
increasing variance.

h2. Getting started

h3. Lisp

The lisp environment is loaded from the compass/trunk/src/
directory. Every file you need to run Compass experiments is located
in that library make file.

To start, fire up emacs and M-x slime while inside src/. To load the
library files, run:

(load "compass")

From there, you can access any of the support functions and datasets.

Other operations:

*Calling a table:* (albrecht)

*Returning the instances from a table:* (table-egs (albrecht))

*Normalizing:* (normalize (table-egs (albrecht)))

*Shuffling data from a table:* (shuffle (table-egs (albrecht)))

*Creating K-means clusters:* (meat-processor 8 (k-means 8 (table-egs (nasa93))))

*Generating a compass tree:* (compass (table-egs (cocomo81)) :distance-func 'euclidean-distance)

*Generating a compass tree on data with a discrete class value:*
(compass (table-egs (sonar)) :distance-func 'euclidean-distance :variance-func 'entropy)

*Outputting a dot file for Graphviz of a Compass tree:*
(dot-compass (compass (table-egs (cocomo81)) :distance-func 'euclidean-distance) "cocomo81.dot")
